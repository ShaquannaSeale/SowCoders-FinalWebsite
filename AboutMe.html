<p> Welcome to my website, Ambrosial Eatz. <br>
My name is Shaquanna Seale and I am from the country of St.Lucia.
</p>
</div class="intro">
<br>
<p id="mu"> Many St.lucians have a higher tendency to buy imported products which are packed with additives,  as opposed to purchasing healthier  local products which in most cases are cheaper than artificial ones. A huge contributor to this is the lack of variety that there is  in the options of recipes which include local ingredients as people often find them repetitive and uninteresting.
I created this website because I would like to increase the use of local
products among natives in my country by providing new food options which
incorporate them into the recipe.

<h2>
The website also has secondary objectives which are as follows:
</h2>
<br>
<ol>
<li id="colors">To help  benefit the local economy by increasing circulation of money within the country</li>
<br>
<li id="colors">To help decrease the consumption of fruits with less additives and increase consumption of those with more nutrients.</li>
<br>
<li  id="colors">To assist in curtailing the issue of global warming and improving our carbon footprint by reducing greenhouse gas emissions released from boats which transport food</li>
